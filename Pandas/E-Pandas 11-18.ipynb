metereological features, such as temperature or wind speed, and was imported from the `NOAA GSOD dataset`, continuously updated to include recent measurments.\n","\n","> Among others, you can find the following columns here:\n","* `Id`\n","* `Country/Region`\n","* `Date`\n","* `temp`: Mean temperature for the day in degrees Fahrenheit to tenths.\n","* `max`: Maximum temperature reported during the day.\n","* `min`: Minimum temperature reported during the day.\n","* `stp`: Mean station pressure for the day in millibars to tenths.\n","* `slp`: Mean sea level pressure for the day.\n","* `dewp`: Mean dew point for the day in [Fahrenheit to tenths].\n","* `wdsp`: Mean wind speed for the day in [knots to tenths].\n","* `prcp`: Total precipitation (rain and/or melted snow) reported during the day in [inches and hundredths]; `.00` indicates no measurable precipitation (includes a trace).\n","* `fog`: Indicators (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported) for the occurrence during the day.\n",">\n","> Note that time of max/min temperatures varies by country and region, so this will sometimes not be the max for the calendar
